### Hi there ğŸ‘‹

<!--
**vndee/vndee** is a âœ¨ _special_ âœ¨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.

I have been a competitive programmer for several years with a strong background in advanced data structures, algorithms and problem-solving skills. Currently, I am in an AI R&D team, working on Deep Learning and some AI-driven projects. This work is bridging the gap between academic research and industrial product. My research focuses on Computer Vision, Natural Language Processing, and knowledge-base inference that are recently empowered by Deep Learning. Keeping track of state-of-the-art research and diving into novel model architectures/theories is my role. It results in technical solutions. 

The best way to reach me is through [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/vndee.huynh), [Email](mailto:vndee.huynh@gmail.com) or [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/vndee/).
